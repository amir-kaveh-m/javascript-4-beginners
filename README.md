## Getting Started

To follow along and to write some code please:

 - Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) from Microsoft

- Install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) from Google

- Download [javascript-4-beginners](https://github.com/go4tech-australia/javascript-4-beginners/archive/develop.zip) from Github and unzip/extract the folder

Using Visual Studio Code open the `javascript-4-beginners` folder. You will see a list of folders in the sidebar. Inside the `src` folder is `index.js`. This is where you will be writing your code.

The `Lessons` folder contains the course content.

The `Exercises` folder contains the course exercises.

The `Challenges` folder contains additional exercises to complete and test you new knowledge.

The `Demo` folder contains a demo example of what you can build by completing all the exercises and challenges. 

The `lib` folder contains the JS library `game.js` and it's associated documentation.

The `Resources` folder contains links to additional learning resources

## What is Programming?

A computer can only perform a series of simple operations when instructed to do so. They normally have no ability to learn, judge, or improvise. They simply do what they're told to do! Their value comes from how they can quickly handle and process huge amounts of information.

A computer often requires human intervention. That's where programmers and developers come in! They write programs, which are really just instructions to a computer.

A computer program (also called an application or software) is usually comprised of one or more text files containing commands, or instructions, in the form of code. This is why developers are also called coders.

A programming language is a way to give orders to a computer. It's a bit like a human language! Each programming language has vocabulary (keywords that each play a specific role) and grammar (rules defining how to write programs in that language).

## Lessons

In this course we will be teaching you four programing concepts which can be applied to practically all modern programing languages. To teach these concepts we will be using the programming language [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/){:target="_blank"}.

JavaScript is the language of the web. It powers billions of websites that billions of people view everyday.

The four lessons are:

- [Variables](Lessons/1%20Variables)
- [Functions](Lessons/2%20Functions)
- [Conditionals](Lessons/3%20Conditionals)
- [Loops](Lessons/4%20Loops)

---

## Exercise

Practice what you learned in the lessons with these [exercises](Exercises/). All your code must go in [src/index.js](src/index.js) file.

1. [Variables](Exercises/1%20Variables)
2. [Functions](Exercises/2%20Functions)
3. [Conditionals](Exercises/3%20Conditionals)
4. [Loops](Exercises/4%20Loops)

---

## Challenges

Test your knowledge of programing in javascript with these [challenges](Challenges/). And prove to yourself that you are a JS master ðŸ˜Š

---

## GAME.js

The library used in the course is called `GAME.js`. The documentation can be found [here](lib/documentation).
