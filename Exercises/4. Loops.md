# Loops

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

Calling `moveSnake` manually becomes tedious. Lets automate it my using a loop. Using a `while` loop to call `moveSnake` three times to move in one direction then with another loop move three times in another direction.

(Optional) Try the same thing but using a `for` loop.

### Exercise 2. 

a. Loops run really fast. Lets slow it down by using the `SNAKE.loop()` function, which will run every second. You can increase the speed by passing in a number to `SNAKE.loop()`.

b. To move the snake while the loop is running pass `moveSnake` to `SNAKE.onArrowKey()`.
