# Loops

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

Calling `moveSnake` manually becomes tedious. Lets automate it my using a loop. Using a for loop to call `moveSnake` three times.

(Optional) Try the same thing but using a `while` loop.

### Exercise 2. 

Three steps isn't far enough. Lets continually move the snake until it runs into a wall. Use `CHUNK.loop()` and pass it your `moveSnake` function.
