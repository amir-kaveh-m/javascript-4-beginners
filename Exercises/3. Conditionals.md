# Conditionals

In `index.js`:

1. 

a. Lets expand on the `moveSnake` function. Inside the function add if/else statments to call the `CHUNK.move()` appropiately. Add a case for `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` and `"right"`.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
var function = moveSnake(direction){
    if(direction === "down"){
        CHUNK.move("down")
    }
}
```

b. Call `moveSnake` and pass in a direction of `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` or `"right"`. The snake should move. Keep calling the `moveSnake` to see it move further.
