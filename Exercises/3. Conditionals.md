# Conditionals

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 21 

a. Lets expand on the `moveSnake` function. Inside the function add if/else statements to call the `SNAKE.setDirectionForSnake()` appropriately. Add a case for `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` and `"right"`. Also call `SNAKE.move()` after setting the direction.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
var moveSnake = function(direction){
    if(direction === "down"){
        SNAKE.setDirectionForSnake("down");
    }
    SNAKE.move();
}
```

Now to test if everything is working correctly, open `index.html` in the browser, open the developer console (see instructions below) and call `moveSnake` by passing in a direction of `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` or `"right"`. The snake should move.
