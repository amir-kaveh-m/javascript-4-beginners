# Conditionals

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

a. Lets expand on the `moveSnake` function. Inside the function add if/else statments to call the `CHUNK.move()` appropriately. Add a case for `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` and `"right"`.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
var function = moveSnake(direction){
    if(direction === "down"){
        CHUNK.move("down")
    }
}
```

Now to test if everything is working correcly, open index html, open the developer console (see instructions below) and call `moveSnake` by passing in a direction of `"up"`, `"down"`, `"left"` or `"right"`. The snake should move.
