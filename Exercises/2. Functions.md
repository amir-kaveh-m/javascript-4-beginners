In [index.js](../src/index.js):

### Exercise 1.

Create a function called `sayMyName` which has `name` as a parameter and returns "Hello " + `name`. Pass in your variable `myName`. You can display the value by using the `alert()` function.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
sayMyName("Go4Tech");
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
"Hello Go4Tech"
```

Troubleshooting:
Adding words together is very similar to adding numbers. Adding words together is called concatenation.

### Exercise 2.


a. Create another variable `snake` and assign it the return value of `GAME.createSnake()`.

b.  `GAME.createSnake()` takes two arguments, the first being a name and the second a color. Try passing the variable `name` as the first argument to `SNAKE.createSnake(). Now try passing a colour as the second argument.

c. Now that you have created your snake, it is time to draw it on the screen. To do that just type in `GAME.draw(snake)` where `snake` is the variable you just created.

Open index.html. You should see your snake drawn on the screen.

Experimentation time:
1. What would happen if you did not type in `GAME.draw(snake)` and open `index.html`?
2. Can you `createSnake()` without specifying any color? Try running it without color argument and see what happens!


### Exercise 3.

a. Create a function called `moveSnake` which takes `direction` as a argument. Inside this function call `GAME.setDirectionForSnake()`, which takes your direction as a argument.

b. You may have notice your snake still doesn't move. After `GAME.setDirectionForSnake()` call `GAME.move()`. Your snake should now be in a different position.

Keep calling `moveSnake` to have your snake move further.

PRO TIP: Your function does not return anything. A function that does not return anything is called a `void` function. See the [GAME](../lib/documentation.md) documentation for more detail.
