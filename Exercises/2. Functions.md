# Functions

In `index.js`:

1. Create a function called `sayMyName` which takes `name` as a parameter and returns "Hello `name`". You can display the value by using the `alert()` function.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
sayMyName("Santa");
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
"Hello Santa"
```

2. Create a function called `moveSnake` which takes `direction` as a paramter which calls another function called `CHUNK.move()` but does not return anything. `CHUNK.move()` takes direction as a parameter.
