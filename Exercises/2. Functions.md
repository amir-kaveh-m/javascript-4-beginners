# Functions

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

Create a function called `sayMyName` which has `name` as a parameter and returns "Hello " + `name`. Pass in your variable `myName`. You can display the value by using the `alert()` function.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
sayMyName("Go4Tech");
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
"Hello Go4Tech"
```

Troubleshooting:
Adding words together is very similar to adding numbers. Adding words together is called concatenation.

### Exercise 2. 


a. Create another variable `snake` and assign it the return value of `SNAKE.createSnake()`.

b.  `SNAKE.createSnake()` takes to arguments, the first being a name and the second a color. Try passing the variable `name` as the first argument to `SNAKE.createSnake(). Now try passing a colour as the second argument.

Open index.html. You should see your snake drawn on the screen.


### Exercise 3. 

a. Create a function called `moveSnake` which takes `direction` as a argument. Inside this function call `SNAKE.setDirectionForSnake()`, which takes your direction as a argument.

b. You may have notice your snake still doesn't move. After `SNAKE.setDirectionForSnake()` call `SNAKE.move()`. Your snake should now be in a different position.

Keep calling `moveSnake` to have your snake move further.

TIP: Your function does not return anything. A function that does not return anything is called a `void` function. See the SNAKE documentation for more detail.
