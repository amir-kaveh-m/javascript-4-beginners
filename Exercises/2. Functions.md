# Functions

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

Create a function called `sayMyName` which takes `name` as a parameter and returns "Hello `name`". You can display the value by using the `alert()` function.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
sayMyName("Santa");
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
"Hello Santa"
```

### Exercise 2. 

Create a function called `moveSnake` which takes `direction` as a parameter. Inside this function call `CHUNK.move()`, which takes your direction as a parameter. Your function does not return anything. A function that does not return anything is called a `void` function. See the CHUNK documentation for more detail.
