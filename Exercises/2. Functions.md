# Functions

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

Create a function called `sayMyName` which takes `name` as a parameter and returns "Hello `name`". You can display the value by using the `alert()` function.

EXAMPLE
```javascript
sayMyName("Santa");
```

OUTPUT
```javascript
"Hello Santa"
```

Troubleshooting:
Adding words together is very similar to adding numbers. Adding words together is called concatenation.

### Exercise 2. 

Create a function called `moveSnake` which takes `direction` as a parameter. Inside this function call `CHUNK.move()`, which takes your direction as a parameter. 

Your function does not return anything. A function that does not return anything is called a `void` function. See the CHUNK documentation for more detail.

Call `moveSnake` to have the snake start in a different position.
