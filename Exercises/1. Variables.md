# Variables

In `index.js`:

### Exercise 1. 

a. Create a variable `myName` and assign it a value of your name.

b. Display your name by passing `myName` to the `alert()` function.

Open index.html. Your name should appear in the alert box.

Troubleshooting: If your name is made up of alphabetical characters remember to wrap your name in double quotations. This is called a string
