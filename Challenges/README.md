# Challenges

The following challenges build off of what you learned in the lessons as well as what you build in the exercises. The challenges can be completed in any order.

TODO: Add challenges
- `add apple:` Can you create an apple on the screen, along with the snake?(Tip: Read the [GAME](../lib/documentation) documentation file for available options)
- `grow snake:` can you grow the size of snake to 1 sqaure everytime it eats an apple (or everytime you move, if you have not implemented apple yet)
- `end game from eating yourself:` Can you kill the snake when its head touches its tail?
- `add score:` Add 10 points to every apple you consume.
- `change color of snake everytime you eat an apple:` Can you randomly change the color of snake everytime it eats an apple?
- `make the game faster when the score increases`

REMEMBER: The library used in the challenges is call `GAME.js`. The documentation can be found [here](../lib/documentation)
