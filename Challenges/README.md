# Challenges

The following challenges build off of what you learned in the lessons as well as what you build in the exercises.

- `Add apple:` Can you create an apple on the screen, along with the snake?(Tip: Read the [GAME](../lib/documentation) documentation file for available options)
- `Grow snake:` can you grow the size of snake to 1 sqaure every time it eats an apple (or every time you move, if you have not implemented apple yet)
- `End game from eating yourself:` Can you kill the snake when its head touches its tail?
- `Add score:` Add 10 points to every apple you consume.
- `Change color of snake every time you eat an apple:` Can you randomly change the color of snake every time it eats an apple?
- `Make the game faster when the score increases`

REMEMBER: The library used in the challenges is call `GAME.js`. The documentation can be found [here](../lib/documentation)
