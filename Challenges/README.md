# Challenges

The following challenges build off of what you learned in the lessons as well as what you build in the exercises.

- `Add apple:` Can you create an apple on the screen, along with the snake? (Tip: Read the [GAME](../lib/documentation) documentation file for available options)
- `Grow snake:` Can you grow the size of snake to 1 sqaure every time it eats an apple (or every time you move, if you have not implemented apple yet)
- `End game from eating yourself:` Can you end the game when the snakes head touches its tail?
- `Add score:` Add 10 points to every apple you consume and display it to the console.
- `Make the game faster when the score increases`.

REMEMBER: The library used in the challenges is call `GAME.js`. The documentation can be found [here](../lib/documentation.md)
